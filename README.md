## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

We want to get an overview overview of the Starbucks population , and how people react to different promotions. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We're going through the Starbucks Capstone Challenge from the Data Scientist Nanodegree at Udacity. In order to know if the demographic characteristics such as age, gender and other characteristic variables of the client such as their income and also their media can influence a client to complete the offer, we will look at the data simulated by Starbucks clients to see their spending habits in relation to the different promotions that have been sent to them.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

There are three different datasets to look at :
portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json — demographic data for each customer
transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following steps

1. Introduction:a brief overview of the project and its objectives is given.
2. Library and Import database: the libraries and datasets used for the development of the work are cited.
3. Database description: a descriptive statistical analysis is generated for the three datasets used and the most significant variables
4. Data Cleaning and Preparing: In this section we clean and prepare the data for each database supplied, let’s start with the first dataset
5. Final basis: the final base is generated, after having joined the previous datasets and their bivariate analyzes.
6. Data Modeling: Pipelines are created for data transformation, with the objective of building a solid database to create a logistic regression model.
7. Conclusion:conclusions are generated on the types of offers, demographic variables of the clients and their communication channels
