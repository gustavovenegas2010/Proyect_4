## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

We want to get an overview overview of the Starbucks population , and how people react to different promotions. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We're going through the Starbucks Capstone Challenge from the Data Scientist Nanodegree at Udacity. In order to know if the demographic characteristics such as age, gender and other characteristic variables of the client such as their income and also their media can influence a client to complete the offer, we will look at the data simulated by Starbucks clients to see their spending habits in relation to the different promotions that have been sent to them.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

There are three different datasets to look at :
portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json — demographic data for each customer
transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following steps

1. Project Definition:a brief overview of the project and its objectives is given.
* Project Overview
* Problem Statement
* Metrics
2. Descriptive and exploratory analysis: A descriptive statistical analysis is generated for the three data sets used and the most significant variables, accompanied by their discussions and data visualization.
3. Methodology Data Cleaning and Preparing: In this section we clean and prepare the data for each database provided, as well as carry out the implementation through algorithms and metrics.
* Data Preprocessing
* Implementation and Refinement
4. Resultss: the results obtained by the models are analyzed and are consistent with the previous descriptive analyzes.
5. Conclusion:conclusions are generated on the types of offers, demographic variables of the clients and their communication channels.
* Reflection
* Improvement
